# High-Performance C++ Matching Engine

This repository contains a **high-performance cryptocurrency matching engine** built in C++. It implements core trading functionalities based on **REG NMS-inspired principles** of price-time priority and internal order protection.

The system is designed for **high throughput and low latency** by decoupling order matching from slower I/O operations (like disk writing and WebSocket broadcasting) through asynchronous queues and dedicated writer threads.

The project includes the core matching engine, a persistent **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** for state recovery, a **REST API** for order management, a real-time **WebSocket API** for market data, and a functional frontend UI to visualize the system in action.

## üöÄ Features

- **Core Matching Logic**: Implements strict price-time priority (FIFO) for all orders.

- **Order Type Handling**:
  - **Standard**: Market, Limit
  - **Time-in-Force**: Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC), Fill-Or-Kill (FOK)
  - **Advanced Order Types (Bonus)**:
    - Stop-Loss (Market)
    - Stop-Limit

- **High-Performance Architecture**:
  - Asynchronous, thread-pooled broadcast queue for non-blocking WebSocket updates.
  - Asynchronous Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for persistent logging without blocking the request thread.
  - Fine-grained locking using `std::shared_mutex` for concurrent reads of the order book.

- **Persistence & Recovery (Bonus)**: All orders, trades, and cancels are written to a WAL. The engine replays this log on startup to fully restore the order book state.

- **Real-time Data APIs**:
  - **REST API** (via cpp-httplib) for order submission, cancellation, and system stats.
  - **WebSocket API** for streaming L2 order book depth and live trade executions.

- **Fee Model (Bonus)**: Implements a simple maker-taker fee model, with fees calculated and included in trade reports.

- **Testing**: Includes unit tests for core matching logic and a high-load benchmark client.

- **Frontend**: A simple HTML/JS frontend is provided to visualize the order book, trade feed, and submit orders.

## üìä Performance

The engine is designed for **high throughput**. Benchmarking was performed using the included benchmark tool (`tests/benchmark.cpp`).

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### 1. Data Structures

The core of the engine is the `OrderBook` class. It uses two `std::map`s to manage bids and asks, ensuring price priority.

```cpp
std::map<long long, std::deque<Order>, std::greater<long long>> bids_
std::map<long long, std::deque<Order>> asks_
```

This design choice provides:

- **Price Priority**: `std::map` automatically sorts orders by price (key). `std::greater` is used for bids to sort them from highest to lowest.
- **Time Priority**: `std::deque<Order>` at each price level acts as a FIFO queue, ensuring orders are matched based on their arrival time.

### 2. Concurrency & Asynchronous I/O

To achieve high performance, the HTTP request thread (which handles order submission) is decoupled from all slow I/O operations.

**Order Submission** (`/orders`):

1. An HTTP request is received by `server.cpp`.
2. The order is placed in the `global_wal` queue (very fast, in-memory push).
3. The order is given to the `OrderBook` for matching. This is a blocking, in-memory operation.
4. Any resulting trades are also pushed to the `global_wal` queue and the `g_broadcast_queue`.
5. The HTTP response is sent immediately to the client.

**Asynchronous WAL**:

- A dedicated thread in the `WAL` class consumes the `queue_`.
- It batches writes and flushes them to the `data/wal.jsonl` file, ensuring persistence without impacting the order matching latency.

**Asynchronous Broadcasting**:

- A thread pool in `BroadcastQueue` consumes the message queue (`queue_`).
- Worker threads format the JSON for trades and order book updates.
- The `WebSocketServer` then broadcasts this data to all connected clients.

### 3. Persistence & Recovery

On startup, `main.cpp` calls `global_wal.replay()`. This function reads the entire `wal.jsonl` file, reconstructs the state of all open orders (handling creations, trades, and cancels), and repopulates the `g_order_books` map before the server starts accepting connections.

## üîå API Specification

The server runs two services: a **REST API** (default port 8080) and a **WebSocket API** (default port 9002).
